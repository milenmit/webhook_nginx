# webhook_nginx

### Just git clone the repository and docker-compose up.
### This will run nginx/redis and webhook and in the end you will have a "a web page" that will consume hooks. 
### I have NO contribution to the project - > https://docs.webhook.site/open-source.html.
### The only thing that i have changes is to add a nginx and nginx.conf also to configure redis to be persistent - not loosing info after docker-compose down and so on.
